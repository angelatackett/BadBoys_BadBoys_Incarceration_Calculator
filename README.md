# BadBoys_BadBoys_Incarceration_Calculator

The code is a simple Python script that calculates the total cost of incarcerating a given number of inmates for a given number of days. The cost is based on a fixed daily rate of $120.59 per inmate.

The script prompts the user to enter the number of inmates and the number of days for which they should be incarcerated. It then calculates the total cost of incarceration by multiplying the number of inmates by the number of days by the daily rate. Finally, it displays the total cost to the user.

The output is a string that informs the user of the total cost of incarcerating the inmates. The cost is formatted to two decimal places using the format() method.
